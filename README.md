# Staffan Bj√∂rnsons CV
Projec is setup to test building LaTex flies with Jenkins in a multi-branch pipeline. Trying to incorperate as meanny best practises as posible. 

The pipeline uses docker to build a PDF and then Ansible to "publish" the document to a NAS. 

TODO:
- Create automated releases 
- Implement Conventional Commits
- Setting version nuber in the document

This is a working progress and will end up building my CV document.
this is the dev branch
